# HPC RSE Meeting Notes: 30 June 2020

 Attendees

## Actions

  - (AndyT/JamesG) Look at organising online event to bring workflow tool developers together with
    HPC RSEs to explore the space and how these tools can be enabled in MFA world.

## Topics of interest

## National HPC RSE Updates

### ARCHER/ARCHER2/Cirrus/DiRAC, EPCC

  - ARCHER2:
    - 1st eCSE call seems to be really popular with lots of applications
    - Lots of work on developing new training. Includes an initial pass on a basic Containers course developed in collaboration with Jeremy Cohen (Imperial College)
  - Cirrus
    - Complete rebuild of system, including move to Slurm and addition of lots of GPU nodes
    - Lots of work to rebuild software packages and update documentation 
    - Looking at how we can configure an EasyBuild toolchain for HPE along the same
      lines as the Cray toolchains
  - DiRAC
    - RSE software development projects continue: SWIFTsimIO functionality, OpenQCD GPU work, AREPO GPU ray tracing and ProMPI GPU porting
    - Tidying up of benchmarking repositories and update of results

### ExCALIBUR benchmarking

  - Working to identify mini-apps and proxy benchmarks to represent algorithms
    of importance for UK research exascale cases
    - Potentially cover seven dwarves of HPC + ML
    - Need to be able to run on experimental hardware with minimal compilers/libraries etc. as well as standard HPC systems
  - Coordination with ExCALIBUR Phase 1 software projects still needs to be picked
    up properly - coordination meeting on 21 July will hopefully provide opportunities
    for this.
