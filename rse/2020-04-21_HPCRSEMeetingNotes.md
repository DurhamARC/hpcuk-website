## National HPC RSE Updates

### ARCHER, ARCHER2, Cirrus, DiRAC, EPCC

   - Oracle bare metal cloud benchmarking
     + Skylake nodes interconnected by 100 Gbps RoCE
     + Benchmarked DiRAC benchmark applications up to 32 nodes
     + Single node performance same as native
     + Multi-node performance similar to single-rail IB cluster
     + Full story at upcoming webinar, see: 
   - DiRAC benchmarks
     + Application benchmarks from the community - QCD, astrophysics/cosmology
     + Baseline across current DiRAC systems
     + Release in open source benchmarking model (as for ARCHER benchmarks)
   - ARCHER2: awaiting delivery of hardware
     + Website now available: https://www.archer2.ac.uk
     + 1st eCSE call planned to open soon: https://www.archer2.ac.uk/ecse/
   - Cirrus: new hardware delivered but not yet configured

### JADE

   - Waiting on delivery for JADE2
   - Working on training materials for deep learning

### MMM Hub

  - Expecting new Tier-2 hardware in middle of May

### Isambard

  - Continued high rate of sign ups
  - Updated Arm compilers
  - Isambard 2 due by the end of the year
  - Have early access to A64FX in Japan

### NI-HPC

  - Finalising acceptance tests based on remote access - should be complete this week
  - Ulster have appointed their RSE will start 1 June
  - QUB will advertise as soon as possible

### N8 HPC

  - Hardware delivered to Durham
  - RSEs distributed across N8 - one from each institution. Some already in place.

### Cambridge

  - Awaiting delivery of new Tier-2 hardware
  - Open Exascale Lab at Cambridge RSE team from Dell to target new Intel architecture - want to hire new RSEs soon. Aligned to ExCALIBUR project (see below)

## Other topics

### Supplier access to site

  - Location dependent
    - UCL have key staff who volunteered to come in to their datacentre
    - EPCC have a rota working to minimise staff on site, suppliers coming in to fix issues with systems
    - Durham: University makes distinction between fixing existing kit (allowed) and building new stuff (not allowed)

### ExCALIBUR and Exascale

  - ExCALIBUR: https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/approach/collaboration/spf/excalibur
  - *Aiming to redesign high priority simulation codes and algorithms to fully harness the power of future supercomputers, keeping UK research and development at the forefront of high-performance simulation science.*
  -  Led by the Met Office and EPSRC (on behalf of UKRI Research Councils) along
with UKAEA, NERC, STFC and MRC.
  - Phase 1 call from EPSRC to fund Design and Development Working Groups to bring together a wide range of domain experts, mathematicians, computational scientists, and Research Software Engineers (RSEs).
    - Call outcome: https://gow.epsrc.ukri.org/NGBOViewPanel.aspx?PanelId=1-811FGY
  - Also a number of hardware testbeds being installed at various sites across the UK to look at different hardware aspects
