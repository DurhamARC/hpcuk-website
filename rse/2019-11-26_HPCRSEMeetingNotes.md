# National HPC RSE Updates

## ARCHER, Cirrus, EPCC

   - MPI benchmarks across a wide variety of systems and MPI libraries now available at: [https://github.com/hpc-uk/archer-benchmarks/tree/master/synth/IMB](https://github.com/hpc-uk/archer-benchmarks/tree/master/synth/IMB)
   - Most complete performance analysis so far is for Alltoallv (as it is important for CASTEP and we were looking at the performance of this specifically), see: [https://github.com/hpc-uk/archer-benchmarks/blob/master/synth/IMB/analysis/IMB_Alltoallv_compare.ipynb](https://github.com/hpc-uk/archer-benchmarks/blob/master/synth/IMB/analysis/IMB_Alltoallv_compare.ipynb)
     + Issues with collectives on Arm systems that are not understood yet

   - Managed to get multi-node MPI Singularity container jobs running on Cirrus. Performance is close to native (non-container) runs
     + Plan to publish technical report or blog article on this

   - Moving ReFrame system regression testing framework into production on Cirrus
     + ReFrame: [https://reframe-hpc.readthedocs.io/en/stable/](https://reframe-hpc.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
     + Cirrus configuration and initial tests: [https://github.com/EPCCed/epcc-reframe](https://github.com/EPCCed/epcc-reframe)

## Isambard, GW4

   - Continues to attract new users interested in Arm.
   - 70 attendees at OpenMP workshop on GPU @ SC19 using Isambard
   - Should be able to provide more specific updates once the annual report is submitted at the end of the month

## HPC Mid+

   - Drop in usage recently - chasing users to try get people to use it up
     + Comment that fluctuations in usage are often seen - tempting to try and post-rationalise to events or other things going on but very difficult to actually link drops to real sociological causes.
   - Struggling to get licensed software configured and running correctly
     + Many sites noted that they also have problems with this 

# Other topics

## Reporting service metrics 

   - How do different services report service time?
     - Depends on ticketing system
     - Question maybe more suited to the HPC-SIG

## Shared HPC RSE knowledge base

   - Blog article on shared UK HPC knowledge base published at: [http://www.epcc.ed.ac.uk/blog/2019/11/uk-public-hpc-knowledge-base](http://www.epcc.ed.ac.uk/blog/2019/11/uk-public-hpc-knowledge-base)
   - Will propose discussion of this as a topic for the next HPC-SIG meeting and plan to do something at next HPC Champions workshop (if not before)
   - May also put in a proposal for the next RSE conference on this

## HPC Champions

   - Started to think about HPC Champions workshops for next year
