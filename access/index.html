summary: Get access to HPC facilities

<h2>Academic Access</h2>

<p>
UK academic researchers can usually apply for access within a grant application. Some 
facilities also offer different methods of access that do not require applicants
to prepare full grant applications.
</p>

<p>
Many facilities have restrictions on remit for free access depending on which research
council has funded the facility. For example, EPSRC and NERC remit can gain free access
to ARCHER; STFC remit can gain free access to DiRAC; and EPSRC remit can also gain free
access to the various national Tier-2 HPC facilities.

<h3>Currently Open Calls</h3>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> The calls listed below are only those that are specifically for HPC
service access. Many <a href="../facilities/">facilities</a> also allow access to be requested
in a funding application or by paying for access. Please see the individual facility pages for 
more information.</p>

<h3 id="simple">Simple Access Methods</h3>

<p>
Instant Access or Seedcorn access is usually a lightweight process to get a small amount
of resource to assess the suitability of a facility for the proposed research. It is also
often used to gather benchmarking data to support an application for larger-scale 
resources.

      <a href="https://www.csd3.cam.ac.uk/">CSD3</a> offers "pump-priming" access to, for example,
          simply test whether a programme compiles and runs,
          benchmark the performance of an application on the system,
          gather the data needed to complete the Technical Assessment required for Open Access applications for resources on CSD3,
          gather supporting data for applying for CSD3 resources on EPSRC grants.
          This will grant a relatively small allocation of resources for a limited period of time (up to six months). 
          Applications for pump-priming access can be made by email to resources@csd3.cam.ac.uk.
