<h2>HPC Applications</h2>

<p>
All users on HPC systems rely on HPC applications for modelling and 
simulation. Getting the best out of the applications you are using is 
critical to advancing your research and maximising the value of the 
HPC resources you have access to.

<h3 id"compiling">Compiling HPC Applications</h3>

<p>
Information on compiling HPC applications is usually available as
part of the standard application documentation. However, many 
HPC applications are complex and the specific instructions for 
different HPC platforms can differ from the standard instructions.
</p>

<p>
A number of resources are available with compile instructions for 
specific UK HPC facilities.

      The ARCHER CSE service at EPCC provides instructions for compiling many 
      applications on the ARCHER UK National Supercomputing service, a Cray
      XC30 system running CLE 5 with the Cray, Intel and GCC compilers;
      and Cray MPI.

       The ARCHER CSE service at EPCC have compiled a small number of large 
       benchmarks to test scaling and performance for real-world scientific 
       problems. Both the benchmarks and latest performance results are 
       available along with a white paper describing how the benchamrks were
       selected.

       The ARCHER CSE service at EPCC have compared the performance of 
       Cray compute nodes based on the KNL Intel Xeon Phi manycore processor
       to standard ARCHER compute nodes based on the Ivy Bridge Intel Xeon
       CPU. There are results and reports for a range of different HPC
       applications.
